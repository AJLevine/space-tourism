Author: Aaron Levine
Title: Space-Travel
Release Date: 4/7/18
Purpose: Coding Project for Tech Academy

This prototype website is my first website project, containing HTML and CSS files (to improve style and incorporate animations).

The website, for a space tourism agency, features space-related image files (not original work and not for distribution) with hovering animations to add content to the images, buttons that lead to different website sections with hovering animation, entry fields for contact information, and submit and terms and conditions buttons also with hovering animation.
